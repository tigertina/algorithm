Algorithm
=========


This repository is all about algorithms,and will be updated per week theoretically(**Well,I have to say,it all depends,depending on the mood of the contributors**)

Algorithms will include all these related algorithms(not limited,although):

* Strings
* Trees
* Graphs
* Sorting Algorithms

And this readme will be updatedÔºÅ(**But I hate to say to this again,it all depends on mood,on the mood of the contributors**)
